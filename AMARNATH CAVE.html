    <h3>AMARNATH CAVE</h3>
    <p>
       AMARNATH, one of the holiest hindu pilgrimage, is well-known worldwide for the naturally occuring shiva linga made of snow.
       since july and august are the only months when it is relatively simple to reach the holy cave, only the shravan months are allowed for this celestial yatra.
       kashmir has,since times immemorial,been the abode of gods and goddesses.

       the eternal lord,which is situated at a height of 13,000ft.from the sea level.it is about 45kms.
